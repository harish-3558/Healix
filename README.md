## 📖 Usage Guide

### Password reset email

Configure `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `MAIL_FROM` in the backend environment. The SMTP account must be permitted to send mail using `MAIL_FROM`. After configuration, restart or redeploy the backend; password reset codes expire after 10 minutes and are limited to five attempts.

   - Students can sign up directly.
   - Counselors sign up but require Admin approval.
   - Admins are pre-configured in the database.

2. **Booking Appointments**:
   - Students select a counselor and available slot.
   - Counselors approve or reject the request.

3. **Using Odyssey AI**:
